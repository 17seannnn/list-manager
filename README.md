# List Manager
Program that give you access to manage dynamic data structures

## Usage
Three modes:
- Single-link list
- Doubly-link list
- Binary tree

For now you can add items to your structure, dispose them and show them.
Later, i want to add some additional features for doubly-linked list and binary tree.

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/17sean/list-manager.git
cd list-manager
gcc main.c -o lm
```
